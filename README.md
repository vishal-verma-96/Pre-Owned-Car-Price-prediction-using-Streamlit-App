# **Data-Science-Capstone-Project**
# Description:
This repository holds the final capstone project for the Data Science with Python Career Program by Skill Academy. It utilizes a Car Details dataset to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), train and evaluate a model to predict car prices, and deploy a web application using Streamlit for user-driven predictions.

# Project Goals:
* **Explore and Analyze:** Conduct in-depth exploration of the car dataset to understand its characteristics and identify potential relationships between features.
* **Visualize:** Create insightful data visualizations to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies.
* **Preprocess and Clean:** Address duplicate values, outliers, inconsistencies, and other data quality issues to prepare the data for modeling.
* **Machine Learning Model Development:** Experiment with various machine learning techniques.
* **Model Evaluation:** Employ metrics to assess model performance, compare different approaches, and select the best-performing model.
* **Sample Prediction:** Demonstrate the functionality of the final model by generating predictions on sample data.
* **Streamlit Deployment:** Develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit for real-time car price predictions based on user-provided parameters.
# Features:
- Comprehensive EDA notebook for detailed data exploration.
- Well-structured code for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- Clear documentation and comments within the code.
- Streamlit app for interactive price prediction.
